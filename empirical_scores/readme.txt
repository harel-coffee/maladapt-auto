MaLAdapt prediction scores for Neanderthal/Denisovan adaptive introgression

Each file contains 4 columns: chromosome name, window start position, window end position, and prediction scores ("prob1"). 

All windows are in hg19 coordinates. We use "prob1>=0.9" as the threshold for calling adaptive introgression candidates
